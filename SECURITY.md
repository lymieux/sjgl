policies for the open source project [Simple Java Geometry

  * [Reporting a Vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability)
  * [Disclosure Policy](#disclosure-policy)

## Reporting a Vulnerability 

**sjgl** project members take security vulnerabilities seriously. 
Thank you for improving the security of our open source software. 
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Reporting a vulnerability is done through a GitHub issue, and
contains information relevant to the issue and it's effects. 
After the initial issue, a contributor will endeavor to keep 
you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or 
team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When a security issue is received, it will be assigned to a contributor. 
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the 
following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be released as fast as possible to Maven.
